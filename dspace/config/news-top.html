<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to BioSpace</h1>
<p>BioSpace is a shared space for archiving and sharing teaching and learning resources related to Biology courses at UBC.</p>
<p>Resources are organized according to biological disciplines and learning goals. These tried-and-tested resources undergo an internal peer-review and feedback process before posting.</p>
<p>If you are interested in posting resources, encourage you to use our template! Although no template is ever going to meet everyone's needs, we hope that this will provide helpful guidelines and standards, ultimately making BioSpace easier to use for both posters and downloaders. If you have any feedback (regarding the template, the site, the resources, or otherwise), please let us know! We would love to hear from you.</p>
