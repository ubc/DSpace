Running a virtual machine with Git, Virtualbox and Vagrant

1. Download GIT (https://git-scm.com/downloads), and register for a Github account

2. Go to UBC's statspace to copy their respository, using the clone function to obtain a URL (https://github.com/ubc/statspace-vagrant)

3. Using git by opening the program git GUI, enter the command ("git clone %link%") to clone the repository 

4. Using git, navigate to statspace-vagrant (cd statspace-vagrant), which will depend on where you have saved it.

5. git clone ubc's dspace (https://github.com/ubc/DSpace), using git.

6. Download virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1) and Vagrant (http://bit.ly/2B9FILt). They require a restart

7. Install plugin (vagrant-hostmanager) through git terminal, using the command "vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager" in the git terminal

8. Use git terminal when running vagrant for the first time, using the command "vagrant up"


Making your own local copy

1. Check configuration: (git config -l)
2. Log in to Github and navigate to the statspace Branch of UBC's Dspace (https://github.com/ubc/dspace/tree/statspace)
3. While logged in, click fork to make your own copy of that branch
4. Check that origin url is directed to your fork of the respository ( e.g. https://github.com/$YOURUSERNAME$/dspace.git), by using (git remote set-url origin https://github.com/$yourUSER$/dspace.git 
5. List an upstream remote url for this on your own Git terminal, (git remote set-url (anyname) https://github.com/ubc/dspace.git
6. Check it all with (git config -l)


To rebuilt 
To rebuild, run these commands while in the directory statspace-vagrant (master)

vagrant ssh
sudo su 
cd /var/dspace-src
mvn clean && mvn -Dskiptests package -P '!dspace-xmlui,!dspace-lni,!dspace-oai,!dspace-sword,!dspace-swordv2'
cd /var/dspace-src/dspace/target/dspace-installer
ant update && sudo /sbin/service tomcat restart

Use command to rectify: 
sed -i 's/\r//' $filename$


Run 'vagrant halt' to stop machine
vagrant up --provision to trigger the provision process


Make sure application compiled 
change the appbase="webapps" to appBase="/dspace/webapps" in /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml 
then restart tomcat using "/sbin/service tomcat restart"

then can access from (localhost:8080/jspui)

TO ACCESS ROOT
after vagrant ssh
sudo -s
Let's you become root user to run the above commands
Identify which user you are by checking the user name prior to @ sign, and the number sign directly prior to the prompt

'/' makes links use an absolute path, remove to make relative ==> should work on all configurations

Exit command (Ctrl+C)

To remove backup folders:
cd /dspace 
rm -rf webapps.bak* (May need root account permissions)
